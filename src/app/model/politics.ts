// Outline
//
// Classically there are stages of political development like this:
// - Egalitarian bands
//   - typically immediate-return hunter-gatherers
//   - status differences but not formalized
//   - leadership by assent of each and all
//   - traditional norms
// - Achievement-based ("big man") societies
//   - typically early hortculturalists
//   - formal degrees of status can be achieved as an adult
//   - leadership by assent of each and all, but emerging client relationships
//   - traditional norms, but perhaps shaped more by big-man choices
// - Ranked societies
//   - typically agriculturalists
//   - families are ranked and status depends heavily on birth
//   - some degree of coercion
//   - traditional norms, but some ability of chiefs and elites to alter them
// - Stratified societies
//   - typically agriculturalists with some degree of urbanization
//   - formal classes and stations
//   - coercion and exploitation generally available
//   - traditional norms still apply but often overridden by authorities
//
// However, our goal is not to have a schematic progression, but rather to
// model the transitions between these kinds of societies, and the causes
// and effects in all power sources.
//
// Starting point: 5000 BC, ranked societies. Although it would be interesting
// to model developments in simpler stages, and at some point we may, not that
// much is happening just yet, so it will be more interesting to start with
// somewhat more complex societies.
//
// Initial model for ranked societies:
//
// - Think about it in terms of 
//   (a) political actions and decisions available
//   (b) effects on other power sources and itself
//   (c) causes of development of additional *single features* of stratified societies
//       and the effects of those features
//
// - Political actions and decisions available
// - Effects on other power sources and itself
//   - Production: 
//     - Coordination bonus to local tile production for all goods
//       - Represents appropriate subsidy, trade regulation, dispute resolution
//     - Ability to create larger irrigation works
//   - Trade: 
//     - Coordination bonus to local trade
//     - Ability to coordinate long-distance trade, including with off-map trade points
//   - Consumption: Utility bonus for redistribution
//   - Technology: Bonuses due to scale, coordination, and subsidy/insurance
//   - Religion: Bonus ability to claim labor
//   - Military:
//     - Coordination bonus to military actions, but relatively minor at this point
//     - Ability to build fortifications
// - Additional features that can develop and their causes and effects
