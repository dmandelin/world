# Latest Synthesis

Treating settlement patterns, politics, and culture together, 
along with other aspects as needed.

Key new ideas:

- There are multiple "markets" people can produce goods and
  services for. First is direct family consumption. Next is
  reputation. There can also be barter, sale, donation, and
  so on.
  - For this to work, we need to model agents that have
    different kinds of interests and demands.
  - Agents can probably be corporate, representing groups
    of people.
  - We'll need to list out the kinds of agents and the actions
    they can take (producing for "markets" and otherwise) at
    the start of the simulation and as things accumulate.
- People with the right kinds of influence can install new
  components of ideology. This can be used to concentrate 
  power, or disperse it.
- Events and choices may be key to political and ideological 
  change. For example, refugees arriving create a choice for
  how to incorporate them, which could lead to increased 
  openness, or exploitation and a new stratification.
- Settlement structure should match archaeological findings,
  and have the right implications for level of political
  and other integration.

## Descriptions of society types in the new synthesis

Ideally, by the time we're done, we'll model societies in
terms of their traits, and band/tribe/etc won't be a primary
concept at all. And for the initial part, we'll be interested
mostly in applying this to the specific history, culture, and
politics of southern Mesopotamia. 

But to get started, it's helpful to sketch how these society 
types are modeled. Note that the titles link ecology and 
society type, but they are not actually that closely linked.
Those are only the typical correlations, which help understand
why those societies have the traits they do.

### Hunter-gatherer "bands"

These people live in local groups of 20-50, which nest inside
regional groups of 20-500. These are kin groups, so people
automatically have an evolutionary and psychological motivation
to care for each other.

We won't need to model these people in detail yet, but
a few notes:
- Age and gender are the main status markers. Groups can be
  egalitarian, or elders and/or men may have higher status,
  depending on their culture.
- Interpersonal disputes may arise, but for the most part
  people are peaceful to others in their regional group.
  They are sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly to each
  regional group near them.
- Their ideology is egalitarian, with food sharing and
  refusal of authority. There are status differences, so
  if we list their traits in detail we would not status
  differences allowed for great food collection and the like.
  It's not possible to accumulate individual property.

### Horticultural "tribes"

These people live in nested kin groups, clans of 50 inside
phrateries inside tribes, and so on. Kin relationships may
be notional rather than real, especially in bigger groups.
The largest groupings might be 2,000-20,000, and typically
there are a few top-level tribes of the same culture: not
politically unified. The tribes are not necessarily a simple,
fixed tree: actual relationships at any time could be much
more complex.

Settlement structure is villages of roughly equal size.

The nested kin groups form an alliance structure in case of
conflict, and there are often rules about which tribes can
marry.

There is no real permanent political leadership or upper
class. There are "big men", individuals who have accumulated
more friends and clients, organize more trade, have bigger
families that produce more food, etc. They may have special
meeting houses they don't allow others into, where they
develop new dances and ceremonies, or organize assassinations.

A key difference with hunter-gatherer society, perhaps, is
that people live much more densely and interact more frequently,
so reputation and relationships become more important. Also,
with sedentism there is a much bigger local market for dances
and rituals, and this compounds with density. And there may
start to be property in the form of livestock, if not yet
land.

Some possible ideological components:
- Tend to have more status difference by age and gender than
  hunter-gatherers, but there is overlap.
- Clans and tribes may own land, but it also may village-based.
- Individuals may own livestock or prestige goods such as beads.
- There may be a name for "big men", which helps to legitimize
  them, although not necessarily all society members will agree.
- Certain rituals, feasts, and status goods (which may then
  become especially valuable trade items) bring status

We don't need to model exactly how societies transition from
a more egalitarian type to this, but a few notes: To prevent
status differences from arising, hunter-gatherers must monitor
each other, which becomes more difficult at scale. Also, culture
(special rituals and such), economics (sedentary building
opportunity) and warfare (if significant in that society) may
automatically generate bigger status differences than before,
which may start to be tolerated because of benefits given.
For the most part, "big men" will have to provide something
of value and can't be exploitative, but that won't be completely
true. In some cases, the rest of the society may band together
to expel or kill the "big men", and it may become more egalitarian
after that.

Some new production opportunities:

- Public goods rewarded with status and/or donations:
  - Rituals: entertainment, knowledge and morale for the people
  - Military: leading the tribe to victory in warfare
  - Feasts and insurance: better nutrition and food security
  - Peacemaking and dispute resolution
  - Other services such as medicine
- Private goods rewarded with subsidiary status and/or sustenance:
  - Elite dress and decorative goods
  - Tools, boats
  - Direct military services
- Public/private non-goods:
  - Bullying by big-man retinues
  - Installing new ideologies, possibly to further enhance
    big-man power.

Costs and benefits should be set so that it's mostly beneficial
to a group to have a few big men around, but also some possibility
of "corruption".

#### Southern Mesopotamia 5300 BC

In 5300 BC, southern Mesopotamia appears to have been something
like this. 

Data from TCOI:

- Flint from Zagros needed for flint hoes to work canals and levees
- Farms might extend up to 3 miles from the village
- Many cattle bones found. Possible use of plows
- Fish
- Sail trade to the Arabian and Iranian coasts
- 'Ubaid 1 pottery style (early version or precursor)
- Clay sickles used on lower Euphrates since further from flint
- (4500) scepters, cosmetics [suggests rank society]

By 4000 BC, they had a 2-level settlement structure, with the
temples possibly as family property, who sponsored artisans
and the like around, as well as having marketplaces. 

from TCOI for 4000:

- Big "temples" by then [suggests chiefly]
- Fine pottery

3600:

- Secular building
- Large granary
- Trade enclaves in upper Euphrates (Syria and Turkey) for
  gold, silver, lead, copper, timber, turquoise, and lapis
  lazuli.
- [suggests strongly developed chiefly]

Eridu "temple" sequence:

- 5300: Small, apparently not built at an existing village.
  Sounds like a "men's house" or the like, indicating this
  is not a chiefdom, although that's not definitive. This
  had burnt offerings, and an alcove.
- 5000-4500: Level 15, now a larger 24'x27' building.
- 4000: Level 11, with 40' central chamber, decorative
  shapes that became standard in the region. Pottery is
  'Ubaid 3.
- 3800: Level 7 and 6, 'Ubaid 4 pottery, incense burners.
  By this time, poettery styles and ritual architecture
  were similar across northern and southern Mesopotamia.

### Agrarian "chiefdoms"

Key markers here are that now families compete for status
instead of individuals, families have semipermanent status,
and "high chiefs" (important members of high-status families)
start to have some coercive authority. Tribal nesting
structures continue, but may be led by subchiefs from the
high-status families rather than being their own autonomous
tribe.

Settlement structure may show 2-3 levels and tends to imply
a similar political structure of subchiefs.

Some ideological traits that might be found:
- Greater yet differences by gender and age.
- Family ownership and improvement of property.
- Some families have more spiritual power/purity than others.
- Certain goods, rituals, etc. have spiritual or status power.
- Donations to chiefs are mandatory.
- Some people are dependents or slaves, from warfare or
  debt.
- Some families provide the ruling class.
- High-status people can't be assaulted.
- High-status people can physically punish those who defy
  them directly.

Societies in an in-between state tend to cycle back and forth
between achievement-based and ranked. Societies become more
ranked by accumulating economic, military, and/or political
power within families over time, combined with installing the
appropriate ideological units. They can also become less ranked:
- Ruling lineage dies out
- Famine/epidemic/war disrupting relationships
- Popular rebellion
- Villages become more independent or trade links break,
  reducing opportunities for specialization and differentiation
  in the center.

Despite the large status differences, chiefs are typically
expected to do right for the people (if allowed to take some
privileges). However, there are enough ideological units here
to make for an exploitative chiefdom in some cases.

Production opportunities:

- Public goods rewarded with support (chiefs tend to be able to
  more or less tax, and have a stable position, but cooperation
  can definitely vary a lot by support level, and rebellion is
  possible):
  - Rituals: more elaborate, impressive, harder to replicate
  - Military: more full-time warriors, more organized expeditions
  - Feasts and insurance: better nutrition and food security
  - Peacemaking and dispute resolution
  - Other services such as medicine
- Private goods rewarded with subsidiary status and/or sustenance:
  - Elite dress and decorative goods
  - Tools, boats
  - Direct military services
- Public/private non-goods:
  - Bullying by chiefs
  - Installing new ideologies, possibly to further enhance
    chiefs' power.

Around 4000 BC, southern Mesopotamia may have transitioning to
this society type. At first, there was not much social differentiation,
just a few elite goods, not very ostentatious and presumably not
very exploitative.

By 3500, it appears to be an elaborated society of this type,
with impressive temples and a 3-level settlement hierarchy. The
chief was probably more or less the chief priest. They would have
had to work with the clan chiefs for any kind of detailed administration,
so there was probably still a lot of power sharing, but it's possible
tax levels were going up, and it's likely more elite goods were
available and were making for more status differences in society.

### Stratified "states"

"Chiefdoms" have many of the features of "states". These are typically
held to be markers of a state:
- 4-level settlement/political hierarchy
- Elaborated permanent political offices
- Taxation
- Professional military
- Writing

Those are all differences in degree, not kind. Stratification
may be held up as a special mark, the idea that now some part
of the population really does have "power over" another and could
exploit it. That also goes with the idea that everything is no
longer kin-based.

This gets at the idea of power-to vs power-over and productive
or distributive power:
- power-to (have a stronger military, write, etc) can develop
  without states, although apparently these items do develop
  much faster/more reliably in states
- power-over (coercion, exploitation) may wax and wane; there
  is some correlation in growth of these two types of power but
  not always.

States are most notable of all as war machines: apparently states
had much more offensive military capability than other society
types, although chiefdoms could be substantial, too. States of 
that type would also have to have developed ideological and
political structures that they can plug conquered peoples of
other cultures into. The key advantages to the state form per se
are probably basically being able to extract more military power
and tax than the population would otherwise provide, and the
expansionist capability.

Note that in states there can be various layers of status, and
institutions that limit the power of rulers.

Some ways to become a state:
- Primary
  - Sacred commerce state: temple elite monopolizes religion
    and gains much property and influence over trade. They have
    state power once they can shape ideology enough.
  - Raider state: stationary bandit.
  - Holy father state: religious ideology develops more strongly,
    so that priestly family becomes (semi-)divine, typically also
    with force.
  - Royal court state: royal family ideology develops more strongly,
    due to a combination of elaborate lineage and military/economic
    power.
- Secondary
  - Reluctant client state: start dealing with a state in limited
    ways, but the state starts to monopolize certain things.
  - Imitative state: either because threatened by the nearby state,
    or elites seeing an opportunity.
  - Progressive state: a more exploitative state deposed and
    replaced by something more inclusive.
  - Conquest state: considered secondary because stratification
    institutions were there before the conquest.
  - Projectural state: memory of a former state formation preserved
    and then a version of it revived in reality

It appears that southern Mesopotamia followed the sacred commerce
path, except that an influx of refugees from Susiana may have been
the key step leading to greater stratification. The temples were
probably building up ideological power as well as economic, with
an increasing amount of property and dependent laborers, as well
as increasing trade and production of more elaborate goods. However,
clans may still have resisted them getting too big. But a huge
influx of refugees came in to Uruk. There is probably a decision
point here, but Uruk may have chosen to admit them as new dependent
laborers. Maybe the clans were OK with that because they wanted 
someone to control the new people and socialize them. But then the
temple gained a massive amount of workers with a new status. The
temple now has predominant economic power, and a new low-status
class that can be gradually extended to other peoples.

## New model components needed

### 5300 BC

We need to try to carefully analyze the "markets", "goods", agent
kinds, agent actions, and the like. At this point I would guess
we have an achievement-based society, but possibly with some aspects
of rank emerging. I'll assume a well-developed clan structure at
least. Population was villages of roughly equal size with plenty
of new land available.

- Agent kinds:
  - Clanspeople: "regular people", representing populations consisting
    of clans of 20-100 people. 1 is a chief. (P2) 2 may be elders.
  - Potters: highly skilled artists creating 'Ubaid 1 pottery. We'll
    assume they are in clans too, with the usual proportion of workers.
  - Prominent clans: the clan of a "big man", who has gained more 
    influence than the usual clan.
- Baseline activities
  - Clan-based agricultural, pastoral, and possibly hunting production.
    - These mainly produce nutrition.
    - (P2) Flax for clothing.
  - Clan-based rituals, celebrations, and games
    - These should use some time and possibly resources, and yield
      modeled benefits (we want to acknowledge their importance, and
      model competition with other rituals):
      - (there probably at least has to be enough food available)
      - significant happiness increase (and low without any rituals)
      - individual and collective morale, small bonus to many things
      - bonus to war and increased raiding (tight solidarity)
      - cultural development (and rituals can level up)
      - there may appear "ritual officers" who provide a leadership
        bonus to ritual production
      - particular effects per myth/ritual
  - Regular raiding, feuds, etc. Societies are pretty small-scale so
    it might be hard to model war and peace in detail, and it seems
    warfare wasn't relatively significant in this time and region.
- Trade goods:
  - (P2) Flint: From Zagros, apparently needed for the agricultural system.
- How agents change from one type to another
  - Becoming a "big man"
    - Primary means, religious: sponsor rituals beyond the clan, which
      must then attract people.
      - Successful versions give increased religious bonuses to
        the audience, and increased bonuses to the providers, such
        as a morale bonus.
      - This doesn't necessarily create any higher-level groupings
        of society just yet. These are small-scale and things are
        fluid.
    - Secondary: high agricultural output via accumulating cattle,
      good land, working hard, and other means. This will tend to be
      interpreted as a sign of having powerful ancestors.
      - Can be used to throw feasts and gain prestige while also
        reducing the effects of nutrition variance on others
    - Also: Fine 'Ubaid 1 pottery can be made by craftspeople employed
      by big men
      - Salable trade good
      - Nutrition bonus (cooking and serving vessels)
      - Small religious effectiveness bonus
    - At this point it doesn't seem like we need to model not having
      big men any more in this time and place, but in general it can
      happen, typically due to violence or general poverty.
  - Becoming a potter or not
    - Regular clans can become potters if there is higher income than
      for base production and they can learn the craft. We can make
      various assumptions about ease of learning, but for now it seems
      we can let people transition freely
- Special actions that agents can take
  - TODO - ideologies, trade goods, and social changes that can start
    creating a rank society (in swing by 4500)
    - trade goods: gems, metals, perhaps fine woods, perhaps better cloth
      - merchant class?
      - other luxury crafter classes?
    - certain clans gaining reputations for ritual expertise or trade
      goods
    - rank society ideologies
    - temples
    - as rank society emerges, instead of "clans of prominent chiefs"
      we have "chiefs of prominent clans". We'll need better names,
      but the name should definitely change at some point.
  - Key goals at this point could be boiled down to modeling the growth
    of political power and the growth of urbanism, for good or ill as
    the cases may be.
    - Urbanism
      - It seems that lots of trade is required for large cities, but
        in the early simulation we are concerned with the appearance
        of the first towns in the region.
      - We can consider the usual IEMP + demographics + ecology and
        how they might grow an urban population.
        - Ideology
          - Ritual leaders can become non-farming population.
            - They can in turn employ assistants, artisans, and others.
            - Contributions may become mandatory and subject to enlargement.
          - Living near the ritual center will be more desirable for
            certain believers. Perhaps 10-25% of the population of the
            region will find it strongly appealing.
        - Economy + ecology
          - Certain settlements may be near areas with more good farmland.
            I'm not sure I want to simulate at that level of detail yet,
            so we could instead model this as a random appeal bonus for
            farmers.
          - 'Ubaid likely had significant trade, but we are modeling
            villages at first, so that is something that will have to
            appear. At first, goods such as pottery and clothes are
            made by clans in each village.
          - Later, we may have growing populations of people in certain
            settlements making export goods such as tools, pottery, clothes,
            jewelry and other art works.
          - Trade will likely be initiated by elites and especially temple
            elites, because they have the biggest demands and the most
            capital. Over time it will reach broader and broader populations.
        - Military
          - Conflict may induce people to collect into larger settlements,
            but we don't necessarily need that at the start.
          - Population aside, fortifications make a town more town-like.
            Early on, we won't even have walls, so don't need to model yet.
          - Bandits might want to live in towns! They'd prefer a more
            anonymous place, with plenty of places to spend their loot.
            They could end up generating an organized crime network, and
            if successful enough, merging with the elite. That too is
            for later.
          - Also later, full-time warriors would of course be non-farming
            populations, and in some societies (including here) would live
            in political centers.
            - They could in turn demand farmers nearby as well as makers
              of military equipment and supplies.
        - Political
          - In later societies people could be outright coerced to move to
            a town, but even early on, political leaders (and perhaps also
            military and ideological) probably had some sway:
            - Political leaders could tell people to move to the city and
              some might, depending on their authority.
            - They could favor the city with tax policies or benefits. This
              would generally have some cost.
            - Political leaders could bully people into moving to the city,
              depending on their intimidation factor.
            - Economic actors can induce people to move to the city by
              - Offering better prices there
              - Offering goods there not available at all in smaller places
                For example, at some point most top elites will want to be
                in the biggest cities.
              - Unfortunately, buying them as slaves and moving them there.
                This probably is starting to happen at small scale at 
                simulation start.
            - Military:
              - Demanding people live there to supply them, depending on
                other actors' need for military services.
              - Forcibly moving people to the city and/or preventing their
                leaving.
            - Ideological:
              - Promlugating ideologies that living in the city is better
                (holier, more cultured, can be different emphases), increasing
                appeal.
              - Appealing ceremonies and giveaways.
        - (back on political generally)
        - Taxation can be spent on various things that would be supplied
          by a population in the tax center. Taxation may also employ some
          people full time.
        - Administrators of some sort. It's not clear at all who or what
          they would be at early stages. There are probably minimal full-time
          people of this type in villages (like the headman only), but
          growing towns will start demanding their services (and creating
          more wealth for them to try to get some of) for more things.
        - TODO: order above sources of urbanization by priority (chronology +
          relevance)
    - Political power
      - TODO: some prime issues are what big-man-type leaders can and do do,
        where rank societies come from, how much we need about tribal structures,
        revenue (amounts and how consensual), political ideologies, what rank
        society leaders can and do do
  - TODO - further changes to chiefly society (around 4000)
    - ideologies with greater power differences? how does this happen
      exactly? taxation?
    - great temples
    - even more luxury goods (do they level up?)
    - somewhere in here, fast pottery wheel for commoners
    - secular buildings
    - granaries
    - seems like we're getting "towns" now -- will need to think about
      where those come from, but obv idea is that chiefly taxation
      creates a bunch of resources so significantly more specialists
      can be sponsored (probably at least a few warriors for defense
      and tax collection at this point). Big chiefs may also be inducing
      people to move to the town to ensure plenty of food supply and
      services
    - probably beginnings of corvee labor too

- Clans and their influence
- Priest class that appears with temples: they are paid by donations
  at first; they start to gain influence
- Artisan class that appears with priests, working for part of the
  donations and providing goods for temples, which they can distribute
  to increase their popularity
- Enlarged farming population that appears to support those people,
  possibly needing some explanation why these people are willing to
  cluster at the temple; maybe they get more access to cultural and
  luxury goods
- Trade goods that start coming in for temples, different luxuries
  at first used for collective purposes
- Optional: Model some people as nomads even in river tiles.

### 4200 BC

By this time, there is significant warfare in Susiana.

### 4000 BC

- By this time, it's possible to install more ideologies to enhance
  temple power
- Population growth generally enhances temple power because information
  scales bigger than other things
- Luxury goods starting to become used as more individual status
  markers; perhaps priests just did this, perhaps they needed to 
  start handing out more stuff to attract the best artisans
- Population structure with other towns that have smaller temples and
  versions of the local structure.
- There should also be more regional differentiation and trade.

### 3500-3300 BC

- Refugees from Susiana massively migrate to southern Mesopotamia
- New state structures are created to handle the refugees.
- Trade with further-out regions becomes more and more important.

## More detailed feature planning

### The beginning: before 5300 BC

- Switch population model to a group of villages of relatively equal
  population that grow together and split to form multiple villages
  once big enough.
- Start with an ideology where some clans have more religious prestige
  and attract donations and religious loyalty from other clans in
  exchange for rituals:
  - Donations: maybe 2% or so
  - Religious loyalty: clans that donate and worship are represented
    as having some amount of respect for the religious leaders
  - Rituals have diminishing returns in the audience size, with effective
    sizes dependent on cost of communication, impressiveness of the
    ritual compared to local alternatives. Audience size 500 at first:
    one village.
  - Overall rituals should be mostly beneficial, with most of the
    benefit accruing to the clans.
  - Ritual effects for agrarian religions:
    - Military morale: small bonus in war
    - Economic coordination bonus for peace and trade site: moderate
      bonus to agricultural productivity, small bonus to trade
    - Cultural elaboration: builds up culture faster
    - Ideology: religious leaders gain more sway in changing ideology
  - Ritual effects for nomad religions (these are perhaps hunter-gatherers
    at this point):
    - Military morale: moderate bonus, also more raiding activity
    - Economic coordination bonus: small bonus to agrarian productivity,
      trade
    - Cultural elaboration: tiny bonus at this point
    - Ideology: religious leaders gain more sway in changing ideology
- Political groups:
  - Religious leaders: want more power, more population, more stability
  - Clans
  - (Optional) Big men
- Tiles can be hostile, with much increased raiding, or peaceful, with
  better trade. This can be between any two interacting tiles.

### The first temples: 5300 BC

Religious leaders or big men can construct a small temple (10' x 10')
and become priests. Religious effects are significantly enhanced and
stabilized, with some spillover effects, but not much dramatic change
yet. The clans retain a great deal of autonomy.

- Temple requires significant labor for 1-3 generations to build.
  Funding is basically from donations, but the priests control the
  temple.
- All religious effects are increased.
  - This should be profitable to the priests with audience size of 1000
    or more, and in practice able to capture a town plus 10-12 villages
    as audience, perhaps 5000 people total.
  - This is still mutually beneficial, but as the temple gets more
    impressive it captures a larger share.
- The temple can gain additional features:
  - Marketplace: improved transaction cost bonus and coordination
    bonus for local production
  - Temple lands: land owned by the temple that generates further
    wealth and expands. Can also gain dependent workers.
  - Artisan quarter: a new class appears, artisans, who sell to priests.
    The artisan goods make rituals more attractive and effective.
    This can generate inventions related to products produced.

### Trade in manufactures: 4500 BC

At this time, the fast pottery wheel is invented, which allows mass
production of quality pottery that provides a significant food security
bonus to users, and quality of life improvement.

Artisans can now sell to the clans in their tile and nearby tiles.
This may produce a significant expansion of the artisan population,
and thus the cities.

There will be economies of scale.

Other manufactures will appear, such as jewelry and clothes, both
for the elites and for the clans. Also tools. This will expand the
number of artisans, and also have other effects:
- Better economic productivity and quality of life
- More effective, more expensive temple rituals
- Escalation in which status goods are required to have elite status
  and the powers of elites (through changes in ideology as well)
- More targeting by raiders, leading to more town fortifications,
  watchtowers and partial walls at this point. Possibly some sort
  of temple guards but no major military forces yet.

### 2-level settlement hierarchy: 4000 BC

Now, each tile will have a temple town of population 2-5,000 with
6-12 villages. This implies that the villages were religiously loyal
to the temple, and then ideologies of loose political subordination
were instituted.

Trade is significant, including luxury goods that are increasingly
expensive and required for elites, and useful goods for the clans.

Concentration of wealth starts increasing, with more dependent
workers.

### Next

This will need to be correlated with the Uruk timeline later, but
the general next things are:

- Expansion of the settlement hierarchy to 3 and then 4 tiers.
  Details TBD, but presumably there's some notion of a service
  town of size N for each set of K villages, and then service
  cities for them, on up. We probably don't want to model all
  the contents in detail, but rather distribute the population
  in a sensible way applying some measure of centralization.
  - This also implies the development of more elaborate political
    ideologies. That in turn probably needs to be preceded by more
    elaborate religious rituals, which represent the nascent political
    feature in the divine sphere, which people will then assent to
    replicating on Earth.
  - At first, everything is probably still mutually beneficial, but
    maybe the big men have evolved into a landowner class that is
    also gaining influence and taking up more resources.
  - We probably get effective taxation somewhere in here. That might
    lead to the development of writing, to increase tax revenue.
- At some point we'll get curtain walls and professional militaries.
  The professional military will enhance the political power of
  its employers, and perhaps now create a coercive rule capability
  (with effectiveness still influenced by ideology).
- Economic concentration will start generating a larger class of
  dependent workers.

- Add ecology:
  - Variable agricultural output
  - Epidemics: apparently there isn't explicit archaeological
    evidence, but various sites saw drastic population loss or
    abandonment for no known reason, so some could be epidemics.

A big break will be:

- Mass immigration from Susiana. This will dramatically increase
  population. There may be some choice about how to respond, but
  the historical path is to incorporate them as new dependent workers.
  They speak a different language, Elamite, and have different customs,
  so they can't be integrated into the clans, but rather must now be
  governed by law. The clans accept this because the alternative
  would be to have a huge number of new communities somewhat take over.
- At this point we also have major military actions.
