Let's get more in depth on politics and related aspects of 
society. It's becoming increasingly clear that we need to
model different agents within the society to make any sense
out of the development of these structures.

At our beginning point, we have different clans that are
combined into some sort of loose rank structure based on
perceived tenure and holiness. Villages are independent,
each perhaps having some sort of tribal identity as a village
as well as the different clans that make it up.

Reminder on general sources of status in these societies:
- Family tenure
- Family holiness -- can probably also be ascribed to
  individuals somewhat
- Expertise -- crafting, trade
- Gifts
- Status display: clothing, housing, monuments
- War -- offensive or defensive success

# General remarks on sources of status on how they work:

- Many of these things seem to go arbitrarily far back: to
  original hunter-gatherer societies or earlier. So, we may
  or may not see current evolutionary causes for any of
  these; they don't necessarily work in any simple functional
  way. However, there will be clear motivations in some cases.

- Tenure seems to go back to the animal kingdom generally.
  People may invade in some cases, out of desperation, or
  if they find an easy opportunity to exploit, but all else
  equal, they'll tend to defer by tenure. Those who have
  been there longer probably have more knowledge, more allies,
  and are highly motivated to defend their position. 
  - Families that want to retain and grow tenure will try to 
    remain in place.

- Holiness, which goes by many culture-specific names, such
  as mana, is the notion of being seen as "blessed" generally.
  So this probably comes from charisma, beauty, a reputation
  for success generally, moral uprightness (including giving
  as customarily expected), and putting on the best rituals.
  This tends to go with a cultural mental model where people
  who are unusually charismatic or successful are see as
  having more mana, or a greater connection to "powerful beings".
  - Families who want to become more holy will:
    - Try to create ritual status displays through IP and trade 
      goods others can't replicate.
    - Organize their families for higher production.

- Status display: This somewhat depends on culture, but not
  entirely. There are many kinds of status display and we
  definitely will not be dealing with all of them right away.
  Most relevant early on are:
  - Powerful affiliation: With "powerful beings", ancestors,
    clan. In the simplest terms, if dealing with people outside
    a circle where you know everyone (bigger than a village),
    you want to advertise the social power you can call on,
    because otherwise who knows what will happen.
  - Wealth: Seems to be a status display in many societies.
    Exact forms will vary but typically the idea is to get
    plenty of ordinary goods and as many superior goods as
    possible. 

- Gifts: The most basic idea is that the giver of the bigger
  gift gains status: the recipient who can't reciprocate has
  a debt to the giver that they can't pay. There's a softer
  version, where gifts act as a sweetener to other sources, and
  a harder version, debt slavery.
  - Would-be gift-givers will need to accumulate goods, and then
    give them away.

- Expertise: Various new processes will demand skilled labor.
  It seems that "at first" this was often for producing elite
  goods such as fine pottery or clothing, which broadened as
  productive technology increases, which we see a lot in modern
  times. However, it's not clear that was always the case: some
  things may have begun as common goods.
  - Families who want to become specialists will need insurance
    capital and access to markets (directly or through a relationship
    with someone else). They'll tend to want to pass down the
    skills.

- War: In less organized societies, this is typically about
  success in raiding generating wealth and/or magical power.
  In more organized societies it tends to be more about service
  to the chiefs (or others who can pay/support) or the city.

# More thoughts on agents

So far the agency is around allocation of land and labor, and
trade: all economic production and exchange. There is perhaps
also a bit of agency in raiding actions (although it's fixed
by culture) and birth rates. We also have creation and adoption
of technology.

What's missing are capital investment, labor-leisure tradeoffs,
culture, and politics. All are potentially very important, so
perhaps we'll need some first-cut version of most of those before
we can get very far. But let's think through different agents
we might want, what they can do, and which of these things are
most important for portraying the growth of cities and social
complexity.

Let's start by imagining some version of an agrarian society
with different independent villages but also exchange and some
commonality of culture and language. Agendas are set and
decisions are made mostly by elders, but ratified by a common
assembly. There is a rank structure among families, but not
huge inequalities yet as there isn't much "stuff". However,
they can have bigger houses, better clothes, and early pottery.
- One problem here is that it's pretty unclear what the sources
  of status actually were. Not clear whether to abstract over
  that or try to get more detailed.

Our next stop in observable development apparently is a pattern
of one "town" of perhaps a few thousand people, surrounded by
ten or so villages of a few hundred. Thus, the town might contain
30-50% of the area's population. Supposedly most people were
still farmers, but I'm not entirely sure what that means. Agrarians
still had a variety of resource collection and craft activities,
which might take up a substantial amount of time, and thus might
convert to a much smaller percentage of farmers if people become
split out by specialty. However, it also seems that in various
periods it was possible to have a largely farming town of that
size.
- Sidebar on farming. 
  - From ACOUP, the typical ratio was about 0.5-1 acres per person.
    - That's a population density of 640-1320. That's on the high
      end so apparently most places weren't completely stuffed
      with highly arable land.
    - That would allow about 150K people per tile.
  - From TCOE, farming discards could be found up to 3 miles from
    a settlement.
    - A circle of 3 miles radius has area 28.3 sq mi.
    - Not all farm areas will be circles: they might be on just
      one side of a river, or there might be lakes or other non-arable
      areas, so maybe 10-20 sq mi available near the settlement in
      many cases.
  - Putting those together, the area around a town might support
    5-20K, or in some cases even up to 50K. The larger numbers
    probably apply only in the most fertile areas such as the Nile,
    and maybe Mesopotamia, too.
  - Thus, the existence of a town does *not* automatically imply
    it's collecting from subsidiary towns. It could simply be the
    biggest area of the best farmland, the closest to a big water
    supply, etc.
  - We can therefore imagine that towns in high-yield areas often 
    grow simply by growing their population: if the area is generally
    good for farming and people like staying near their ancestors,
    the population can simply grow in place.
    - However, in the earlier stages of Mesopotamian population
      growth, it seems that the numbers but not the sizes of villages
      increased. And this seems to have been a common pattern.
      Apparently people didn't like living in bigger settlements,
      or tended to start encountering problems that led them to split
      up. But then something changed, and certain sites grew larger.
      We'll need to understand this, or have some plausible model:
      Issue 1 for later.

# The temples

The other big visible change is the appearance of "temples". This
word seems like it can mean many things.
- An early "temple" might really be a secret society house or
  prominent shrine: they might be quite small.
- Later buildings were bigger, with multiple entrances, and could
  hold more people, though usually not huge numbers.
- Giant monuments come after that but appear to be monuments,
  not temples per set.
- "Temple"-type sites sometimes also appear to be, or have next to
  them, secular buildings such as meeting halls or marketplaces.

The significance of the "temples" in early Mesopotamia is unclear,
and as the period spans a few thousand years, may have changed quite
a bit over time.

I've been thinking of the early "temples" as basically entrepreneurial
in character, "upstarts" modifying existing common religious beliefs
to make something new and more impressive. So, in our agent-based
model, temples appear as some group gains the resources to build
a temple and start holding new, more impressive rituals.
