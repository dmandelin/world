# Motivating problems

Next step is a "wealth bonus" for eminent families, but the current
model doesn't make it very easy to do this. The reason is that the
eminent families don't actually collect any produce, we just implicitly
redistribute.

There are related issues with trading and raiding. Eventually, we'd
want to model employment of people in trading, and seizure of trade
goods in transit via raiding, and the present model doesn't help too
much with that.

Finally, although the production2 model allowed for more flexible
allocation, it's clunky in certain areas. For example, there isn't
a very clean model for reallocating land.

Post-finally, we're going to need leisure time soon, so it's be good
to fold that in as well.

# Solutions

One natural move at this point is to get more stochastic: at each
reallocation turn, explicitly model different sets of people switching
between roles and occupations. We can include merchants and raiders
in that cycle. We may also be able to get rituals on more of an even
footing.
