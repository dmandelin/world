Ideas after reasessing how to more quickly make progress on
interesting things happening:

# Economics

Economics is in decent shape -- it's the richest model so far.
The main thing we need is more trade goods and more regional
imbalances, so things can happen.

- Add Fine Pottery as the initial trade good
  - Economies of scale should favor producing for a population
    of 1000+
  - Effects:
    - Small bonus to food production (not super significant but
      probably helps preserve a few things)
    - Bonus to health (especially for use in feeding infants
      and invalids)
    - Bonus for prestige: luxury good
    - Bonus for ritual amenities: incense burners and such,
      plus decorations
    - High demand for this good using surplus income
  - This will create a bit of potential for urbanization, elitism,
    and an industry that can grow

Later add goods for map edges:
- South: Fish
  - Cheap protein source
- West: Flint and Obsidian (Tool Stone)
  - Bonus to farm productivity
  - Small bonus to health (razors, scalpels)
  - Small bonus to military effectiveness (better stone weapons)
- East: Lapis Lazuli and other Gems
  - Bonus to prestige: luxury
  - Bonus to rituals
- North: Goats
  - Can make this a cheaper source than on-map

At time goes on we'll get some more important goods:

- Mass produced pottery: utilitarian pottery benefits for all,
  small prestige bonus
- Donkeys: better trade
- Carts: better trade, military logistics
- Bronze: better tools, weapons
- Fine Clothes: prestige, ritual, small health bonus
- Mass produced clothes: fine clothes but much less prestige
- Wood: for certain buildings

# Demographics

Give settlements an identity, but allow grouping them:
- Have a concept called a district, which can include one or
  more settlements along with rural areas around them
- Initial districts are simply villages (abstracting away
  outlying hamlets and isolated people or groups outside),
  which can grow to towns.
- People move around among districts according to amenity value
  and activation energy.
- Later, if we need to, we can push related smaller districts
  into a bigger one to group up districts.
  - It's not clear exactly what we need to track about the
    entities within when this happens, but we probably at
    least need to keep some distinction urban vs suburban
    vs rural, perhaps tracking key settlements or tiers.

# Politics

We start with independent villages. People apparently pay a
customary tax which funds elites. They in turn perform ritual
functions and perhaps give some key gifts such as fine pottery.

Later we see towns surrounded by villages, but the political
situation is unclear. Let's speculate that there may be some
influence but not hard control at this point. Main questions
would be, do the villages contribute to defense or taxes in
the town?
- In some cases the villages will be "junior military alliance
  partners", where they're buying defensive help from the bigger
  town, often in exchange for reciprical help in a subordinate
  role. This could happen voluntarily for defense or as the
  outcome of a war.
- It seems like that tax-receiving elites in the town would
  try to collect some tax from the village, but how much they
  succeed might depend on things like how much prestige they
  have, how much force, how much administrative capability.
  In general, we should have power project very weakly at first
  (low taxation on non-core areas) but allow various developments
  to increase it.
- The village could become fully subordinate, either as a result
  of war, or by accepting leadership for benefits such as access
  to trade and rituals.

At a still later time we see cities surrounded by settlements
of various sizes. Here too, we probably don't yet have "authoritarian"
government (which perhaps came in with the first expansionary
empires), but presumably even more influence than a town: more
toward the higher than the lower end of the items above, given
more resources to project power. Those resources will also often
be centralized population thus projection causes urbanization as
well.

We'll probably want some substructures inside districts as they
grow to town size and larger. We could have political factions
such as:

- Commoners (rural, suburban, urban)
- Elders
- Priests (could be of different kinds)
- War party
- Resisters

# Culture

Here also we don't know a lot about what was going on. But key
stuff we're gonna want to have includes:
- Cultural components unlocking new possibilities in other
  domains
  - Temples
  - Ritual elaboration, ritual elements
  - Culture of using certain trade goods, e.g., culture of
    lapis makes it much higher demand and prestige
  - Culture of tax donations of various kinds and levels
  - Culture of allowing elites to make certain decisions
  - Culture of new types of warfare, e.g., conquest
- Culture sweeps of new pottery or ritual styles: the new
  culture brings some kind of new bonus, but the change
  can bring conflict
- Cultural exhaustion: bonuses decline as people get used
  to culture, culture sweeps can help fix
- Cultures changing their goals, combining splitting
- Internal cultural conflict
